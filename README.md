This is a small replica of excel sheets with limited features created in c++ with graphics created using sfml,
in this sheet each cell is 4 directional pointer that means it can move in all four directions and can easily add remove data or add remove rows anywhere
in linear time,
This project was assigned to us in our DSA course
Do configure sfml in your project (preferably use vsual studio) before cloning this project
Hope you like it
